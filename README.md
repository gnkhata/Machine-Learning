# Machine-Learning

Projects for Machine Learning class at University of Arkansas Fall 2021.

**assignment1.ipynb** implements linear regression from scratch to predict the death rate from several features, including annual precipitation, temperature, population, income, pollution, etc. 

**Assignment2.ipynb** implements of Support Vector Machines  via Gradient Descent from scratch; the code predicts  if a person doesn't have diabetes (negative class) or has
diabetes (positive class). The data used in the code is from National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. A total of 8 features is used, including Preg (number of times pregnant), Pres (Diastolic blood pressure), Mass (body mass index), etc. There is a total number of 760 patients in the data.

**assignment3.ipynb** implements a neural network to recognize handwritten digits from scratch. The code implements the forward propagation algorithm for prediction, and also to implement the backpropagation algorithm for learning the weights.
